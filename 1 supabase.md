### 3. Getting Started & Project Setup
- **Sign up for free** on app.supabase.com via GitHub or email/password.
- On free tier: 500 MB database, 1 GB storage, 50,000 monthly active users etc.
- **Create a project** by providing:
  - Project name
  - Strong database password (save it!)
  - Region choice
  - Choose plan (Free or Pro ~ $25/month)
- After creation, access the dashboard where you manage:
  - Multiple projects & organizations
  - Settings, tokens
  - API keys and docs

---

### 4. UI Overview & Docs
- Superbase provides a **web studio** to manage databases visually.
- Offers well-written, detailed **documentation** with guides for React, Next.js, Vue, Flutter, Svelte, and more.
- See API references with **auto-generated code snippets** based on your database schema.

---

### 5. Database: Tables, Schemas & Data Types
- Uses **PostgreSQL**, so tables are relational and support SQL queries.
- Visual **Table Editor** to:
  - Create tables with columns (UUID, text, dates, booleans, JSON, etc.)
  - Enforce **constraints**: primary keys, unique, nullable, defaults.
  - Use UUIDs with built-in generators for unique IDs.
- Import data via CSV/Spreadsheet.
- Organize with **schemas** (namespace-like): e.g., public, auth, your custom schemas.

---

### 6. Example: Building “Clients” and “Orders” Tables
- Example demonstrated:
  - Clients table: UUID id, created_at timestamp, email (unique, required), is_active boolean (default true), user_id.
  - Orders table: UUID id, created_at, client_id (foreign key), price, address, zipcode, city, order_name.
- Set data validation by constraints.
- Insert initial/fake records via UI or SQL editor.
- Enforce foreign key relationships visually or via SQL.

---

### 7. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
- Essential for controlling **data access by user/session**.
- Disabled by default in Postgres, **enabled by default in Superbase** (Secure by default!).
- Without policies, no access is granted.
- You define policies for tables regarding:
  - SELECT (read)
  - INSERT (add)
  - UPDATE (modify)
  - DELETE (remove)
- Role-based: e.g., *authenticated user* can insert, but not *anonymous* visitors.
- Example policies:
  - Only owner can SELECT/UPDATE/Delete their data.
  - Enable insert for authenticated users.
- Use **templates** or custom SQL conditions.
- Can combine policies (e.g., owner-only + admin access on different rules).
