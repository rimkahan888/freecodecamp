---

### 3. Getting Started & Project Setup
- **Sign up for free** on app.supabase.com via GitHub or email/password.
- On free tier: 500 MB database, 1 GB storage, 50,000 monthly active users etc.
- **Create a project** by providing:
  - Project name
  - Strong database password (save it!)
  - Region choice
  - Choose plan (Free or Pro ~ $25/month)
- After creation, access the dashboard where you manage:
  - Multiple projects & organizations
  - Settings, tokens
  - API keys and docs

---

### 4. UI Overview & Docs
- Superbase provides a **web studio** to manage databases visually.
- Offers well-written, detailed **documentation** with guides for React, Next.js, Vue, Flutter, Svelte, and more.
- See API references with **auto-generated code snippets** based on your database schema.

---

### 5. Database: Tables, Schemas & Data Types
- Uses **PostgreSQL**, so tables are relational and support SQL queries.
- Visual **Table Editor** to:
  - Create tables with columns (UUID, text, dates, booleans, JSON, etc.)
  - Enforce **constraints**: primary keys, unique, nullable, defaults.
  - Use UUIDs with built-in generators for unique IDs.
- Import data via CSV/Spreadsheet.
- Organize with **schemas** (namespace-like): e.g., public, auth, your custom schemas.

---

### 6. Example: Building “Clients” and “Orders” Tables
- Example demonstrated:
  - Clients table: UUID id, created_at timestamp, email (unique, required), is_active boolean (default true), user_id.
  - Orders table: UUID id, created_at, client_id (foreign key), price, address, zipcode, city, order_name.
- Set data validation by constraints.
- Insert initial/fake records via UI or SQL editor.
- Enforce foreign key relationships visually or via SQL.

---

### 7. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
- Essential for controlling **data access by user/session**.
- Disabled by default in Postgres, **enabled by default in Superbase** (Secure by default!).
- Without policies, no access is granted.
- You define policies for tables regarding:
  - SELECT (read)
  - INSERT (add)
  - UPDATE (modify)
  - DELETE (remove)
- Role-based: e.g., *authenticated user* can insert, but not *anonymous* visitors.
- Example policies:
  - Only owner can SELECT/UPDATE/Delete their data.
  - Enable insert for authenticated users.
- Use **templates** or custom SQL conditions.
- Can combine policies (e.g., owner-only + admin access on different rules).

---

### 8. Authentication System
- **Built-in full auth system** with:
  - Email/password signup & login
  - Passwordless magic links via email
  - Social logins (Google, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, Discord, etc.)
  - Phone (SMS) login
- Invite users, manage accounts in the dashboard.
- Auto-generated verification, invitation, password reset **emails** with customizable templates.
- Configure redirect URLs for local and production environments.
- Manage all users from the Auth dashboard, status, providers used.
- The SDK provides functions for:
  - signup()
  - login()
  - reset password
  - logout()
  - session handling

---

### 9. User Management, Recovery, and Email Templates
- Password recovery flow built-in (reset sends link via email).
- Customizable HTML email templates (signup, invite, password reset, etc.)
- Variables to personalize content: user email, links.
- Configure **site URLs and redirects** to handle local vs. production seamlessly.
- Example: user requests reset → email → link opens reset form on your app → updates password.

---

### 10. Data Operations (CRUD) with the SDK
- Query data securely via SDK:
  - Select (*fetch with filters, sorting, pagination*)
  - Insert (*add new records*)
  - Update (*modify existing*)
  - Delete (*remove*)
- Generated code snippets per table to get started.
- Supports filters like equals, greater than, less than, in-list, case-insensitive, etc.
- Supports pagination with range()
- Automatically respects RLS policies.
- Sample covered: fetching orders, adding new order, updating prices, deleting orders.

---

### 11. Real-time Subscriptions
- Listen to data changes **live** in the frontend.
- Subscribe to CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE events per table.
- Useful for chats, CRMs, dashboards, notifications.
- Enable real-time replication on table settings.
- SDK uses simple API: .channel().on().subscribe()
- Supports filtering subscription events.
- Example updates UI orders list in real time as data changes in DB.

---

### 12. Table Relationships and Views
- Visual interface or SQL to configure foreign keys.
- Fetch related records with simple syntax: e.g.,
  - .select('*, related_table(*)')
- Supports nested selects, multiple depths.
- Ensures relational integrity (no orphans).

---

### 13. Functions (Stored Procedures) in PostgreSQL
- Write **PL/pgSQL** functions to run complex server-side logic.
- Call from API using SDK with .rpc()
- Example: Increment a views count on a record.
- Define via UI or SQL editor.
- Pass arguments, get results in JSON.

---

### 14. Triggers
- Automated server-side hooks.
- Fire **before or after insert/update/delete** to run a function.
- Example: After user signup, insert user profile into another table.
- Manageable via GUI or SQL editor.
- Linked to your custom functions (created earlier).

---

### 15. Schemas for Namespaces
- Organize your DB by **schemas** (logical namespaces).
- Examples:
  - auth schema: system auth tables
  - public schema: your app data
  - sales schema: sales-related data
- Allows same table names in different schemas.
- Helps multi-tenancy, data separation, admin vs. public data.
- Create schemas via SQL.

---

### 16. File Storage (Buckets)
- Built-in scalable file storage.
- Create “Buckets” (like folders or S3 buckets).
- Buckets can be **public or secured**.
- Upload/download files via the dashboard or SDK.
- Store images, avatars, docs, etc.
- Bucket access also protected via RLS policies.
- Generate public URLs or secured download links.
- Organize files via folders inside buckets.

---

### 17. Logs & Analytics
- Superbase provides detailed **logs** for:
  - API requests
  - Auth events
  - Storage access
  - Real-time subscriptions
- Filter logs by timeframe, severity, type.
- Useful for debugging, monitoring, and security auditing.
- Export logs as CSV.
- Performance insights on slow queries.

---

### 18. PostgreSQL Extensions
- Superbase supports popular **Postgres extensions**.
- Adds extra features without code:
  - http: HTTP calls inside Postgres functions
  - pg_graphql: server GraphQL layer
  - pgcrypto: cryptographic functions
  - pgjwt: JWT handling inside SQL
  - geometric types, PostGIS (geo), UUID helpers, etc.
- Enable via GUI toggle.
- Use inside functions/triggers for added power.

---

### 19. Real-time Demo App (Chat)
- Built a demo chat app where:
  - Messages are stored in “posts” table.
  - Subscribe to new messages via real-time.
  - Anyone (or only logged-in users) can post.
  - Changes show up instantly in all clients.
- Enable real-time broadcasts on posts table.
- Add insert/read policies (for everyone, or restrict by auth).

---

### 20. Edge Functions
- Ability to **write serverless backend code** integrated deeply with your app.
- Runs **on Deno runtime** (TypeScript/JavaScript).
- Use cases:
  - Payment processing (Stripe)
  - Calls to 3rd party APIs
  - Custom business logic
  - Bots
- Develop locally, then deploy via CLI to Superbase edge.
- Use SDK inside function to access your Superbase DB.
- Manage environment secrets securely.
- Control authorization: secure by default.
- Cheaper & faster than running own backend server.

---

### 21. Webhooks
- Configure **database webhooks** to call external APIs on events.
- Trigger via table events (insert/update/delete).
- Define events, method (POST, GET), targets.
- Use for:
  - Syncing with 3rd party systems.
  - Triggering CI/CD.
  - Sending notifications to other platforms.
  - Updating search indexes, caches, etc.
- Can trigger external HTTP endpoints or edge functions.

---

### 22. Self-hosting Superbase
- Superbase is open-source — you can self-host!
- Use Docker to host on your infrastructure (your laptop, servers, Raspberry Pi).
- CLI helps you:
  - Authenticate with your Superbase account
  - Init a local project
  - Start containers (Postgres, API, Studio dashboard)
  - Develop with local database.
- Good for testing, development, data sovereignty.
- Migrate between local and Cloud with CLI migration commands.
- Guides provided in docs.

---

### 23. Final Recommendations & Course Conclusion
- Superbase is **powerful, easy, flexible** – perfect for prototyping and production.
- Saves time compared to rolling custom backends.
- Works for small apps, startups, agencies, or as a Firebase alternative.
- Open source and portable; no vendor lock-in concerns.
- Actively developed & improved.
- Suggestion: Start on the free cloud hosted platform, then shift to self-host if needed.
